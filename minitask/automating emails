'''
This is a script that sends an email to a recipient with an image attachment.

The recipient's email address is obtained through user input, and the email is sent every hour using the schedule library. 

The script uses the smtplib library to connect to Gmail's SMTP server and send the email, and
the ssl library is used to create a secure context for the connection. 

The EmailMessage class from the email library is used to create an email message object that contains the header fields and the email body text. T
he script runs indefinitely using a while loop, and the schedule.run_pending() function is called at each iteration to run any scheduled tasks.
