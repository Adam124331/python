"""
summary
The program generates a random number between 1 and 20 (inclusive) using the random.randint() function, 
and then repeatedly prompts the user to guess the number.
The program compares the user's guess with the random number, 
and prints a message indicating whether the guess is correct, too low, or too high.
If the user fails to guess the number within 5 tries, 
the program prints a message indicating that the user has lost the game.
