"""summary
The flatten_list() function takes a list as input and returns a flattened list with all elements from the input list, 

following the conditions specified in the prompt.
If an element in the input list is itself a list, the function recursively calls itself on that list until all nested lists have been flattened. 
The function uses a for loop to iterate over each element in the input list, and an if-else statement to check whether the element is a list or a primitive data type.
If the element is a list, the function extends the result list with the flattened list returned by recursively calling itself on that list.

If the element is a primitive data type, the function appends the element to the result list. Once all elements have been processed, 
the function returns the result list.
