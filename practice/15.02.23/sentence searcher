summary
The sentence_searcher() function takes two arguments, txt and word.
It splits the txt string into sentences using the full stop as a delimiter,

then iterates through each sentence to look for the word. If word is found in a sentence,
the function returns the entire sentence with the full stop at the end. If word is not found in any sentence, 
the function returns an empty string. The search is case-insensitive, meaning that it will match word regardless of whether it is in uppercase or lowercase letters.
