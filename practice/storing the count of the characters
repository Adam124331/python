"""summary
 importing the pprint module from the Python Standard Library. 
pprint (pretty print) is used to print the contents of a dictionary in a more readable format.

The message string is defined and an empty dictionary new_dic is created.

A for loop is used to iterate over each character in the message string. 
The setdefault method is used to set a default value for each character in the new_dic dictionary. If the character does not already exist as a key in the dictionary, it is added with a default value of 0.

For each iteration of the loop, the value of the current character in the new_dic dictionary is incremented by 1.

Finally, the pprint function is used to print the contents of the new_dic dictionary. 
The result shows the count of each character in the message string.
