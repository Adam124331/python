"""summary
The code above is a simple implementation to remove adjacent duplicates from a list in Python. Here's how it works:

Create an empty list new_list to store the elements with duplicates removed.
Start a for loop to iterate through each element i in the original list L.
Within the for loop, check if new_list is empty (len(new_list) == 0) or the last element of new_list is not equal to i (new_list[-1] != i).
If the condition is true, append i to new_list.
Repeat the loop until all elements in L have been processed.
Finally, print the new_list to see the result.
The new_list will only have an element appended to it if the previous element is not the same. This way, adjacent duplicates are removed.
