principal = float(input("Enter the principal amount: "))
rate = float(input("Enter the rate of interest: "))
time = float(input("Enter the time in years: "))

# Calculate the simple interest
simple_interest = (principal * rate * time) / 100

# Print the result
print("Simple Interest is: ", simple_interest)


output:
Enter the principal amount: 5000
Enter the rate of interest: 2
Enter the time in years: 3
Simple Interest is:  300.0



'''
Simple Interest (SI) is calculated by using the formula:
SI = (principal * rate * time) / 100

where principal is the initial amount, rate is the interest rate (as a percentage), and time is the number of years.
