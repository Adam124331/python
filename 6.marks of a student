#summary
'''
In this program, the user is prompted to enter the marks for each of the 6 subjects, which are stored in variables subject1, subject2, subject3, subject4, subject5, and subject6.
The program then calculates the total marks by adding up all the individual subject marks and stores it in the total variable.
The average marks are calculated by dividing the total marks by 6, which is the number of subjects and stored in the average variable.
Finally, the program prints the results of total and average marks.
