"""
summary:
The code takes a string as input from the user and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string.

capitalize_first_letter_of_words is the main function that takes a string as input and capitalizes the first letter of each word in the string. 
The function first splits the input string into separate words using the .split() method, which returns a list of words.
Then, for each word in the list, the first letter is capitalized using the .upper() method 
and the rest of the word is added to the capitalized first letter to form a new word.
The capitalized words are stored in a new list capitalized_words.
Finally, the .join() method is used to join the capitalized words into a single string separated by spaces, which is the output of the function.

The user input is obtained using the input function
, which prompts the user to enter a string and stores the entered string in the variable user_input.
The input string is then passed as an argument to the capitalize_first_letter_of_words function, which returns the capitalized string.
This capitalized string is then printed using the print function.
