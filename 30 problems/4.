"""
In this code, the function animals(chickens,cows,pigs) takes in the number of chickens, cows and pigs as input 
and calculates the number of legs for each type of animal using the input values and basic arithmetic operations. 
It then adds up the number of legs for each animal to get the total number of legs and returns it.

The input is taken from user, by casting them to int, and 
then passed to the function, where the calculation is done and returned.
