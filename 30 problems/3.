#finding the Nth even number

"""
In this code, the function nth_even takes an integer n as input. 
The function first checks whether the input number is 0. If the input number is 0, i
t returns a message indicating that 0 is the first even number.

If the input number is greater than 0, 
it calculates the nth even number by multiplying (n-1) with 2
