"""
The above code creates a Calculator class with four methods add, sub, mul and div. 
Each of these methods takes in two numbers as arguments and performs the corresponding operation on them. 
The methods return the result of the calculation.

You can use the class by instantiating an object of it and then call its methods. 
In the example above, we created an object of the class by calc = Calculator() 
and then called its methods add, sub, mul, div on this object.
